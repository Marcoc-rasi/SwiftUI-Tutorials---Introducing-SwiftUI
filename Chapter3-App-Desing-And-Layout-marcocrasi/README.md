# `Chapter 3 â€“ Application Design and Layout`

Explore the structure and design of more complex interfaces built with SwiftUI.

## `Unit 3.1 - Composing complex interfaces - Introduction`

The category view for Landmarks displays a vertically scrolling list of horizontally scrolling landmarks. As I build this view and connect it to my existing views, I'll explore how composite views can adapt to different device sizes and orientations.

- `Section 1`: Add a category view
- `Section 2`: I created a list of categories
- `Section 3`: I created a category row
- `Section 4`: I completed the category view
- `Section 5`: Added navigation between sections

## `Unit 3.2 - Working with UI Controls - Introduction`

In the Landmarks app, users can create a profile to express their personality. To give users the ability to change their profile, I will add an edit mode and style the preferences screen. I will work with a variety of common UI controls for data entry and update the Landmarks model types each time the user saves their changes.

- `Section 1`: Show a user profile
- `Section 2`: Add an editing mode
- `Section 3`: Define the profile editor
- `Section 4`: Delay the propagation of the edition
