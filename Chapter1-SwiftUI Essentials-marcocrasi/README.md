# `Unit 1.1 Creating and combining views Introduction`

I followed a tutorial that guided me through building Landmarks, an app to discover and share the places I love. I have started by building the view that shows the details of an emblematic place.
To style the views, I have used `stacks` to combine and overlay the `image` and `text` view components. To add a map to the view, I have included a standard `MapKit` component. As I've refined the view layout, `Xcode` has provided real-time feedback so I could see how those changes translate into code.


- `Section 1`: Create a new project and explore the canvas
- `Section 2`: Customize the text view
- `Section 3`: Combining views using stacks
- `Section 4`: Create a custom image view
- `Section 5`: Use SwiftUI views from other frameworks
- `Section 6`: Compose the detailed view

# `Unit 1.2 Building lists and navigation - Introduction`

With the basic detailed view of the landmark set up, I need to provide a way for users to see the full list of landmarks and to view details about each location. I will create views that can display information about any landmark and will dynamically generate a scrollable list that a user can tap to see a detailed view of a landmark. To fine-tune the UI, I'll use Xcode to render previews on different device sizes.

- `Section 1`: Create an emblematic place model
- `Section 2`: Create the row view
- `Section 3`: Customize row preview
- `Section 4`: Create the list of emblematic places
- `Section 5`: Make the list dynamic
- `Section 6`: Configuring navigation between list and detail
- `Section 7`: Pass data to child views
- `Section 8`: Generate previews dynamically

# `Unit 1.3 Handling User Input - Introduction`

- `Section 1`: Mark favorite emblematic places
- `Section 2`: Filter List View`
- `Section 3`: Add a control to toggle state
- `Section 4`: Use observation for storage
- `Section 5`: Adopt the model object in your views
- `Section 6`: Create a favorites button for each emblematic place
