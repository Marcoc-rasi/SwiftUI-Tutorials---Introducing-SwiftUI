# `Introducing SwiftUI`

I've been exploring SwiftUI, a modern way of declaring user interfaces for any Apple platform. I've been building beautiful, dynamic apps faster than ever.

## `Chapter 1 SwiftUI Essentials`

I've been learning how to use SwiftUI to compose rich views from simple ones, set up data flow, and build navigation while watching it in Xcode preview.

- `Unit 1.1 Creating and Combining Views Introduction`: Creating the `Landmarks` application with `views` of `landmarks` details using `stacks` to combine `images` and `text`, along with a `map` of MapKit in Xcode to get real-time feedback.

- `Unit 1.2 Building lists and navigation - Introduction`: Views will be implemented to display information about `Landmarks` and generate a scrolling list for users to access the details of each location. Xcode will be used to adapt the interface to different devices.

- `Unit 1.3 Handling User Input - Introduction`: A switch will be added to the list so that users can filter and see only their favorite places in the Landmarks app. In addition, a star-shaped button will be implemented so that users can mark an emblematic place as a favorite.

## `Chapter 2 - Drawing and animation`

I discovered how to draw shapes and paths to create a badge that I animated, while creating seamless transitions between views.

- `Unit 2.1 - Draw paths and shapes - Introduction`: The tutorial taught me how to create badges for each emblematic place visited, combining paths and shapes. I experimented with overlapping symbols, varying repetitions, angles and scales to create multiple insignia for different types of landmarks.

- `Unit 2.2 - Animating views and transitions - Introduction`: With SwiftUI, you can easily animate changes to views or their state, no matter where the effects occur. SwiftUI handles the complexity of these blended, overlapping, and interruptible animations. In this tutorial, I will animate a view with a graph to follow the user's walks in the Landmarks application, using the `animation(_ :)` modifier.

## `Chapter 3 - Application Design and Layout`

Explore the structure and design of more complex interfaces built with SwiftUI.

- `Unit 3.1 - Composing complex interfaces - Introduction`: The category view for Landmarks presents a vertical list of landmarks with horizontal scrolling. By connecting it to my existing views, I will explore how composite views adapt to different devices.

- `Unit 3.2 - Working with UI Controls - Introduction`: In Landmarks, users can create profiles to express themselves. I'll add an edit mode and design the preferences screen so you can edit your profiles.

## `Chapter 4 - Framework Integration`

I used SwiftUI views along with platform-specific UI frameworks' views and view controllers.

- `Unit 4.1 - Interacting with UIKit - Introduction`: I worked with SwiftUI to integrate it with Apple's user interface frameworks. For example, I mixed UIKit views inside SwiftUI. In one tutorial, I turned the featured home screen into a carousel using UIPageViewController and coordinated data updates throughout the UI.

- `Unit 4.2 - Creating an app for watchOS - Introduction`: In this tutorial, I leveraged my knowledge of SwiftUI to migrate the Landmarks app to watchOS with ease. I added a watchOS target to the project, copied the shared data and views from iOS, and customized the SwiftUI views for watchOS.

- `Unit 4.3 - Creating a macOS app - Introduction`: After creating Landmarks for watchOS, I will bring the app to Mac. I will add a macOS target to the project, reuse existing views and data, and adapt the views for all platforms.
