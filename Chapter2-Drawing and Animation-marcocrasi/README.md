# `Chapter 2 - Drawing and animation`

I discovered how to draw shapes and paths to create a badge that I animated, while creating seamless transitions between views.

## `Unit 2.1 - Draw paths and shapes â€“ Introduction`

I received a badge every time I visited a landmark on my list. Of course, in order for me to receive a badge, I needed to create one. This tutorial walked me through the process of creating a badge by combining paths and shapes, which I then overlaid with another shape representing the location. If I wanted to create multiple badges for different types of landmarks, I experimented with the overlapping symbol, varying the amount of repetition or changing the different angles and scales.

- `Section 2` : Draw the background of the badge
- `Section 3`: Draw the badge symbol
- `Section 4` : Merge the front and background of the badge

## ` Unit 2.2 - Animating views and transitions - Introduction`

When I used SwiftUI , I was able to individually animate changes to views or a view's state, no matter where the effects were. SwiftUI handles all the complexity of these blended, overlapping, and interruptible animations for you.
In this tutorial, I'll animate a view that contains a graph to track the walks a user takes while using the Landmarks app . Using the ` animation ( _:)` modifier, you'll see how easy it is to animate a view.

- `Section 1` : Add hiking data to the app`
- `Section 2` : Add animations to individual views`
- `Section 3` : Animate the effects of state changes`
- `Section 4` : Customize View Transitions`
- `Section 5` : Composing animations for complex effects`
